Testing the concept of using vector basis to calculate collision.

Clicking in the grey canvas makes a point that moves towards wall/shape. For visibility, the points are given some size so collision might look like it goes through the wall but due to the nature of the test (testing points/mouse click collisions) i have chosen to ignore it. The moving points are merely for visual representation only. 

Putting vectors into the text fields to the right will change the wall shape. write the vectors in the form x, y (e.g. 255, 250). As a simple test i didn't do any checking for the points you try to input so if you put points that makes weird quads (this doesnt work if the area is too small interestingly) or points outside the canvas the programming wont stop you. After inputing your vectors click on reset to change the wall and remove any points generated. 

have fun making weird walls and homing dots
